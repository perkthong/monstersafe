Group Members: Kaylin, Jeremy, Perk, and Gregory

<<<<<<< HEAD
# API's from:
1) https://covidactnow.org/data-api free API that shows COVID data for all 50 states
2) http://www.heatmapapi.com/Default.aspx free heat map API
3) https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation Google Maps API (required for heat map to work)

## User Story:
We want to share information with the masses about COVID19. Our group wants to keep people up to date with the latest information from trusted sources, such as: Stanford Medicine Research Center, Harvard Global Health Institute and Georgetown University.
With our website, users can check the most current COVID19 infected numbers per state.

## User Story:
If people are feeling like too much irrelevant information is flooding out of all new sources. People want clean cut and easy to digest information that is not overwhelming. Now Group 7 has come together to create a highly interactive website that gives users updated information about COVID19 across all 50 states from trusted sources.
