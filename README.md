# Group 7 Project

Monster Safe: COVID19 map and information per state

Group Members: Kaylin, Jeremy, Perk, and Gregory

hosted on GitHub: https://perkthong.github.io/monstersafe/

# API's from:
1) https://covidactnow.org/data-api free API that shows COVID data for all 50 states
2) http://www.heatmapapi.com/Default.aspx free heat map API
3) https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation Google Maps API (required for heat map to work)

## User Story:
We want to share information with the masses about COVID19. Our group wants to keep people up to date with the latest information from trusted sources, such as: Stanford Medicine Research Center, Harvard Global Health Institute and Georgetown University.
With our website, users can check the most current COVID19 infected numbers per state.

# Future goals:

1) we hope to have both API's working together on our website
2) have all 50 states show data (confirmed cases, Vaccines Administered, and ICU beds available )
